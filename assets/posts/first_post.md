I've been working on this pretty simple site for a while now. 
In the beginning thinking, that it shouldn't be too hard to build something from the ground up in a
web-framework that I'm quite familiar with. Well, here we are after 1 failed try about 4 months ago
and another lazy month of constant reiterations during off-hours and whenever I was bored.

Let's get to the point. What has been done so far? That's the thing, *basic functionality*. Including:

- [The homepage](/)
- [Registration](/register)
- [Login](/login)
- [Email confirmation / verification](/account/confirm-email)
- [Individual posts](/posts/1)

and that's already about it...

A lot of this included building up the very rudimentaries like design, authentication, and planning 
(or rather lack there of). Turns out, not caring about security enough leads to getting your domain
blocked, too! I definitely learned a lot about the consequences that lack of security leads to.

Anyway. What's planned for the future? Due to my inability to plan something properly, not much yet.
Something that I've actually written down, though, is a 
[simple URL shortener](https://github.com/nanoyaki/nanoyaki.space/blob/main/src/Controller/UrlShortenerController.php)
that may include some tracking functionality. More about that can be found in 
[my GitHub repository for this page](https://github.com/nanoyaki/nanoyaki.space). Pull requests,
critique, and suggestions are very welcome!

I might document some of my future plans or endeavours through this blog in the future, so feel free
to come back! Also excuse the looks and lack of headings, as I didn't consider those until writing this
post-
